Here are some comments which I noted during learning and develoment:

== Things that did not work out as expected

- Spec: Add a sign-up link, but the provided link leads to the sing-in page

- Rubric: "When the user taps a pin, it displays the pin annotation popup, with the student's name => (pulled from their Udacity profile) <= and the link associated with the student's pin
  => This is misleading as it might specifiy to pull every student's name from Udacity after loading the data from the Parse server.
     But Udacity only returns the first and last name for the logged-in account, so this does not make much sense (it does not make sense at all :] but is a good exercise for async data loading)

- Facebooks information "You have already authorized..." after the login. This looks like a common problem to many developers, so I did not do a deeper investigation. There is for sure a simple solution.


== What I did not do (by intention)
- I did not reuse the POST for updates of StudentInformation (Http-PUT) as it gets more complicated -> no advantage
- I did not test all possibilities of StudentInformation's property values set or not set or empty (e.g. it looks like Parse returns an error, if the last name is not set)
- I added a minimum URI check with canOpenURL(...) to just check it. Check could be better, but I think it is enough for this project. If the URI is invalid nothing happens, there is no alert view.
- I did not put all error string into constants
- I did not check the case of getting multiple users from the Parse server for one uniqueKey. The first one in the list is chosen. The case of having more than one item returned, points to a bug in the app (or a badly designed DB)
- I did not add a question for updating a user. If the user has already posted her/his location, the location and the media url is preset.


== What I did do
- I left some prints
- I set the network timeout to 10s


== What I really missed (no requirements)
- Unit tests (I am wondering if at least some kind of testing is introduced in project 4)
